## S3-Keploy

A simple CRUD application to showcase Keploy integration capabilities using [Go-Fiber](https://gofiber.io/) and [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

## Prerequisites

1. [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
2. [AWS Access Key and Security Key](https://aws.github.io/aws-sdk-go-v2/docs/getting-started/#get-your-aws-access-keys)

## Running app on Ubuntu 22.04.03 LTS

### Setting aws credentials

Go to home directory      
Create `.aws` folder        
Inside `.aws` folder, create `credentials` name file        
Open `credentials` in any text editor and add following :       

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = <YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
aws_secret_access_key = <YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
```
### Setting up application

```
git clone https://github.com/keploy/samples-go && cd S3-Keploy
go mod download
```

### Capture the Testcases

```shell
sudo -E env PATH="$PATH" keploy record -c 'go run .' 
```

#### Routes
